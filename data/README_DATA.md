# Dataset instructions

The script expects these CSV files in the repository root (same folder as `run_thesis_models.py`):
- `ship_fuel_efficiency.csv`
- `Ship_Performance_Dataset.csv`
- `marine_engine_fault_dataset .csv`  (note the space before `.csv`)

If your datasets come from third-party sources (e.g., Kaggle), download them from the original source to comply with licensing.
This repository may not distribute full raw datasets.

After placing the CSV files next to `run_thesis_models.py`, run:
`python run_thesis_models.py`
